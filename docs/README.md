# Release Update – November 14th, 2022

See what's new in AIMvision and what we are gradually roling out.
This is a general maintenance release that contains enhancements, bug fixes and some new features. 

## Bug Fixes

### MLA CSV download issue
Fixed: The order in which the columns come out seems to be random with each individual download. For example, the ‘State’ column will be column G on one download and column B on the same download just executed again. This is only true for the attributes like State, Vintage, etc. The actual metrics appear in a consistent order at the end.

### Querybuilder CSV download issue
Query builder CSV download in Sandbox prioritizes the attributes over the date when it orders the data.

### Report page error
Resolving report errors caused due to household implementation
